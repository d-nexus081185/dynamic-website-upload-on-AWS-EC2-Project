You can run this as a root user or as an Ubuntu user.
In this case all commands were run as a root user.

first I switched from Ubuntu >> Root user
sudo su

I update the EC2 instance dependencies and default Libraries
apt update -Y

I installed Apache web server
apt install apache2 -Y

I changed directory to the Apache directory where the index.html file for the apache installation is located
cd var/www/html

I downloaded the website file I want to host on the EC2 instance
wget --content-disposition https://html5up.net/paradigm-shift/download
apt isntall unzip
unzip html5up.net/paradigm-shift.zip

cp -r [folder-name]/* /var/www/html/

Copy and paste the public IP of the EC2 instance to any web browser 
The contents of the index.html file will be displayed fully.
